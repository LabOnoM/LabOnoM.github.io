# Bioinformatics Study Group at Okayama University (BSGOU): Vision and Strategic Plan

## Vision Statement

BSGOU envisions a future where bioinformatics drives a **deeper understanding of life’s complexity** through the seamless integration of diverse expertise and cutting-edge technologies. By uniting students, researchers, clinicians, industry professionals, and engineers, BSGOU aims to **catalyze new theories and models** that bridge high-throughput data and the rich complexity of living systems. The ultimate vision is to **advance global health and knowledge** by transforming vast biological data into actionable insights and holistic understanding.

## Scope

### Scientific Scope

BSGOU defines bioinformatics broadly to encompass all computational and informatics approaches that **digitize, analyze, and interpret biological and biomedical data**. This ranges from genomics and proteomics (e.g. RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, mass spectrometry) to imaging and clinical informatics. High-throughput technologies are recognized as foundational data sources, but BSGOU’s scope goes further – towards **integrative and systems-level approaches** that can model the **dynamic, multi-scale complexity** of biological systems. In pursuit of this, the group encourages work on **multi-omics integration, computational modeling, machine learning, and new theoretical frameworks** that better represent living systems beyond reductionist data analysis.

### Activity Scope

To achieve its mission, BSGOU engages in a wide range of activities that facilitate knowledge sharing, collaboration, and innovation:

- **Conferences and Symposia**: Organizing an annual international bioinformatics conference and thematic symposia. For example, BSGOU will host an annual Bioinformatics Integration Summit at Okayama University, inviting global experts to present research on multi-omics and systems biology. These events provide a platform for networking and showcasing cutting-edge advances.
- **Workshops and Training**: Offering regular workshops, tutorials, and training sessions for all skill levels. Concrete example: BSGOU will run hands-on workshops on topics like single-cell data analysis, machine learning in bioinformatics, and clinical genomics. Beginner-friendly sessions (for biologists/clinicians) and advanced hackathons (for tool developers) ensure that each member – from students to physicians – can develop relevant skills.
- **Collaborative Research Initiatives**: Fostering collaborative projects across disciplines and institutions. BSGOU serves as a hub for forming interdisciplinary research teams – for instance, connecting clinicians with data scientists to jointly study complex diseases. The group may facilitate collaborative grant applications, data-sharing agreements, and student exchange programs to drive projects such as modeling tumor evolution using genomic and imaging data.
- **Software/Tool Development**: Supporting the creation of open-source bioinformatics software and pipelines. Through hackathons and code sprints, members co-develop user-friendly tools (e.g. a platform for integrated multi-omics analysis or a novel data visualization software). These efforts not only produce useful tools but also encourage best practices in software development and reproducibility.
- **Publications & Communication** Promoting the dissemination of research and knowledge through publications and outreach. BSGOU members collaborate on scholarly papers, review articles, and a regular association newsletter or blog highlighting important discoveries. The group may also partner with journals or launch an online open-access journal supplement for conference proceedings. Public outreach (e.g. public lectures or policy white papers) is included to raise the profile of bioinformatics and its contributions to society.

By maintaining such a broad but well-defined scope, BSGOU ensures it covers the full spectrum of bioinformatics – from data generation to theory – while offering concrete programs (conferences, workshops, research projects, tool development, publications) to realize its vision. This clarity of scope and offerings aligns with best practices for professional societies, which emphasize defining target activities (such as conferences, seminars, publications, advocacy) and unique benefits for members.

## Mission Statement

The mission of BSGOU is to **advance the field of bioinformatics through an inclusive, collaborative, and innovative community**. Based at Okayama University but international in reach, BSGOU brings together students, academic researchers, clinicians, industry experts, and engineers to:

- **Collaboratively tackle complex biological problems** using computational approaches,
- **Develop and share novel bioinformatics tools** and methodologies, and
- **Disseminate knowledge** via conferences, workshops, and publications.

In pursuing this mission, BSGOU is committed to **bridging the gap between data and discovery**. It seeks to transform high-throughput data into meaningful biological insights by fostering cross-disciplinary teamwork and by nurturing the emergence of new models and theories that better explain living systems. The organization also dedicates itself to **training the next generation** of bioinformaticians and promoting open, reproducible science for the benefit of the broader scientific and medical community.

## Strategic Goals

1. **Foster Interdisciplinary Collaboration**: Create a vibrant network of members from academia, healthcare, industry, and engineering to break down silos. BSGOU will facilitate partnerships and communication across disciplines, recognizing that diverse teams (e.g. a clinician’s domain knowledge paired with an engineer’s technical skills) spark innovative solutions.
2. **Advance Integrative Research and Theory Development**: Support research that integrates multiple data types and scales, pushing beyond incremental analyses toward holistic models of biological systems. A strategic goal is to incubate projects that combine, for example, genomics, transcriptomics, and phenotypic data to generate new insights, and to encourage theoretical work (such as network biology or computational modeling) that can capture emergent properties of living systems.
3. **Promote Innovation in Tools and Methodologies**: Encourage the development of novel bioinformatics algorithms, software, and computational workflows. BSGOU aims to be a launchpad for innovative tools – for instance, by providing grants or mentorship for software projects – and to set standards in open-source practices, reproducible research, and data sharing within the community.
4. **Empower Education and Training**: Build capacity by offering training programs, mentorship, and resources for members at all career stages. BSGOU will strategically focus on upskilling biologists in computational methods and conversely informing computational experts about biological contexts. The goal is to help alleviate the current shortage of skilled bioinformaticians by producing well-rounded professionals, and to make advanced bioinformatics techniques more accessible to non-specialists.
5. **Global Outreach and Community Leadership**: Establish BSGOU as a unique contributor on the international stage of bioinformatics. This includes forging links with other societies and initiatives worldwide, hosting internationally attended events, and contributing to global discussions (e.g. on data standards or ethics). By doing so, BSGOU strives to amplify its impact beyond the local region and to lead by example in addressing worldwide challenges in the bioinformatics field.

## BSGOU’s Unique Contributions

- **Inclusivity**: All member types (students, clinicians, engineers) contribute uniquely.
- **Theory + Practice**: Bridging hands-on analysis with conceptual modeling of life systems.
- **Global + Local**: Based in Okayama University, active in international collaboration.
- **Open, Collaborative Culture**: Shared learning, mentorship, and co-development are core.

## Addressing Global Bioinformatics Challenges

### 1. Data Integration
BSGOU promotes multi-omics research, working groups, and joint projects to integrate heterogeneous data types and model biological complexity.

### 2. Reproducibility
We promote open-source practices, standard pipelines, and even host reproducibility hackathons.

### 3. Skills Gap
Our workshops, mentorship, and inclusive training upskill clinicians, students, and non-CS researchers.

### 4. Ethical, Legal, and Social Issues
We address ELSI through panel discussions, community guidelines, and support for FAIR principles.

### 5. Scalability and Infrastructure
We leverage institutional and cloud computing to support high-volume analyses and train others to use scalable tech.
