## ✍️ Everyone Can Contribute: Fork, Pull Request, and Build Together

We warmly encourage anyone—regardless of age, nationality, or career stage—who resonates with our core values to participate in co-building the BSGOU community. Thanks to GitHub, you can propose your ideas via **Fork & Pull Request** workflows. Here’s how you can get involved:

- 📖 Share your experimental stories or ideas on biomedical science by submitting to our blog:
  <br>👉 [https://www.bs-gou.com/blog/](https://www.bs-gou.com/blog/)
  <br>💾 GitHub: [LabOnoM.github.io/_posts](https://github.com/LabOnoM/LabOnoM.github.io/tree/main/_posts)

- 🧪 Propose new wet-dry integration methods and workflows via:
  <br>👉 [https://www.bs-gou.com/DK.BeesGO/](https://www.bs-gou.com/DK.BeesGO/)
  <br>💾 GitHub: [DK.BeesGO](https://github.com/LabOnoM/DK.BeesGO)

- 💬 Suggest improvements to our core values or site content at:
  <br>💾 [LabOnoM.github.io/sources](https://github.com/LabOnoM/LabOnoM.github.io/tree/main/sources)

You can also post your comments or feedback as **GitHub Issues** or join our community discussions. Every form of input—contribution, comment, or correction—is logged and counted toward your [BSGOU Contribution Score](https://www.bs-gou.com/2025/06/12/BSGOU-Contribution-Score.html).

🎁 And yes, all BSGOU revenues (donations, ads, etc.) are shared with contributors proportionally—see [members](https://www.bs-gou.com/members.html). Don’t wait—register GitHub and become a member via your profile README.md (example: [wong-ziyi](https://github.com/wong-ziyi))!
