## ✍️ Everyone Can Contribute: Fork, Pull Request, and Build Together

We warmly encourage anyone—regardless of age, nationality, or career stage—who resonates with our core values to participate in co-building the BSGOU community. Thanks to GitHub, you can propose your ideas via **Fork & Pull Request** workflows. Here’s how you can get involved:

<ul>
  <li>
    📖 <strong>Blog Submission</strong><br>
    👉 <a href="https://www.bs-gou.com/blog/">https://www.bs-gou.com/blog/</a><br>
    💾 GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/LabOnoM/LabOnoM.github.io/tree/main/_posts">LabOnoM.github.io/_posts</a>
  </li>
  <p></p>
  <li>
    🧪 <strong>Wet-Dry Integration Workflows</strong><br>

You can also post your comments or feedback as **GitHub Issues** or join our community discussions. Every form of input—contribution, comment, or correction—is logged and counted toward your [BSGOU Contribution Score](https://www.bs-gou.com/2025/06/12/BSGOU-Contribution-Score.html).

🎁 And yes, all BSGOU revenues (donations, ads, etc.) are shared with contributors proportionally—see [members](https://www.bs-gou.com/members.html). Don’t wait—register GitHub and become a member via your profile README.md (example: [wong-ziyi](https://github.com/wong-ziyi))!
