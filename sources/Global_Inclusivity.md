# Global Inclusivity

## 🌐 Locally Rooted, Globally Open
BSGOU is founded at Okayama University but built for the world. Through our Bees GO! program, anyone—regardless of geography, affiliation, or background—can become an active participant in our learning ecosystem. Joining is as simple as creating a GitHub profile with a README.md that declares BSGOU membership (e.g., example of [@wong-ziyi](https://github.com/wong-ziyi)). From there, learners can freely fork our public teaching repositories, which feature open-source code, assignments, and automated workflows to support hands-on programming practice.

To reduce barriers and foster true educational equity, we are actively developing GitHub Actions and apps that automatically evaluate students’ code. All learners, whether local or remote, can raise issues or ask questions via our interactive DK.BeesGO platform. This public system ensures that every step of the learning journey—from practice to feedback—is transparent and accessible.

💬 Peer Learning Across Borders
Anyone in the global bioinformatics community—not just instructors at Okayama University—can review assignments, offer feedback, or create pull requests. This encourages peer learning, cross-cultural mentorship, and open code review, echoing best practices in open science and reproducible research.

By updating their GitHub profile to reflect BSGOU membership, contributors are automatically tracked on our [members page](https://www.bs-gou.com/members.html). Their participation—whether through reviewing code, fixing bugs, or mentoring others—is recognized and quantified by our GitHub-integrated contribution tracking system.

🤝 Shared Recognition and Support
In keeping with BSGOU’s values of fairness and inclusivity, we commit to redistributing 20–30% of all community donations directly to active contributors—including students. This financial model is not merely symbolic; it reflects our belief that educational engagement and technical mentorship are real contributions that deserve recognition.

🚀 Inclusive by Design
This structure reflects the broader mission of BSGOU: to empower diverse learners, encourage open collaboration, and bridge local efforts with global impact. Whether you’re a medical student in Okayama, a clinician in Europe, or a programmer in Africa, you can meaningfully contribute to—and benefit from—our shared pursuit of scientific discovery and digital health innovation.

We believe inclusivity is not an afterthought but a structural design principle. That’s why everything we build is open-source, publicly visible, and globally scalable.
