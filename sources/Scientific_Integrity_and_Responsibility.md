# How We Uphold Scientific Integrity & Responsibility

## Why Scientific Integrity Matters

Scientific integrity is the foundation of credible and impactful research. By adhering to transparent, ethical, and reproducible practices, we ensure our discoveries contribute reliably to science and society.

## Our Principles

 - All studies undergo peer review and internal data audits.
 - All code and data are, where possible, made public.
 - Authorship follows ICMJE guidelines.
 - All human/animal studies comply with international or local ethics standards.
 - We welcome post-publication review and corrections.

#### O‐GlcNAcylation Regulates Osteoblast Differentiation Through Morphological Changes in Mitochondria, Cytoskeleton, and Endoplasmic Reticulum  
*BioFactors. 2024. [doi:10.1002/biof.2131](https://doi.org/10.1002/biof.2131)*  
**Authors:** Yao Weng, Ziyi Wang, Heriati Sitosari, Mitsuaki Ono, Hirohiko Okamura, Toshitaka Oohashi

##### Summary of the Study

This research uncovered the crucial role of O-GlcNAcylation—a post-translational modification—in regulating osteoblast differentiation via changes in mitochondria, cytoskeleton, and endoplasmic reticulum structure. Using a combination of bioinformatics, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, AI-assisted imaging, and rigorous validation, the team identified how Ogt knockout impairs osteoblast differentiation and mapped the regulatory network linking O-GlcNAcylation to mitochondrial and cytoskeletal function.
